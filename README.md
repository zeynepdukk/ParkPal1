This project is a mobile application aimed at optimizing parking managment in urban areas. The objective is to develop a user-friendly platform that streamlines the process of finding available parking spaces, thereby reducing time wastage and improving overall efficiency. ParkPal caters to two types of users: drivers and attendants. Drivers utilize the app to navigate streets supported by ParkPal, checking for vacant parking spots on the map and making reservations when available. The system employs a coded reservation mechanism for booking convenience. Upon reservation, users receive directions to the designated spot, each equipped with a unique, refreshed code for identification. Attendants, on the other hand, mark parking spots as occupied or vacant. By matching codes with those used by drivers, attendants ensure seamless communication and accurate spot status updates. 
ParkPal aims to alleviate the parking challenges in bustling cities like Istanbul, offering a solution that enhances time management and minimizes frustration for both drivers and attendants.
